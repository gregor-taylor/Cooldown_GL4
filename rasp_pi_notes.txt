Additional info to get system working with rasp pi.

-Installed PyVisa, pyvisa-py and pyusb
-Initially this resulted in the USB devs being detcted but with a "Can't get full address..." type error.
-Resolved this with the following:
In terminal:
    sudo -i
    cp /etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules.BAK (Backed up the file)
    nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules
and ADD
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", MODE="0666", GROUP="usbusers"
then 
    /etc/init.d/udev restart
then add permission group
    groupadd usbusers
    usermod -a -G usbusers USERNAME

-This resolved the address issue but the Keithley wouldn't respond to write commands (despite saying SUCCESS and *IDN? commands working)
-Fixed this by manually putting the 2230G into remote using DEVICE.write("SYSTEM:REMOTE")
